I.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>June</i>
1, 1819.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. <span class="smcap">Hairby</span>,</p>
<p>I have sent you a little more scribble to read, which will
amuse you for an hour.&nbsp; Will you be so kind as to send them
all to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>?&nbsp; You need not
seal them, though I hope the Lord will seal you; but he has
already, for the spirit in the heart is the king&rsquo;s seal,
saying, <i>This</i> is mine&mdash;the Church is a fountain
sealed; and every sensible token that you have had, every smile
and ray of spiritual joy, every gracious promise applied to the
heart, and every time love is sensibly felt, this is the sealing
of the Spirit.&nbsp; Christ was sealed by the Father when he was
chosen in eternity, he was the Son of God; but perhaps he was not
sensibly sealed by the Holy Spirit till his baptism, when,
probably, both the Father and the Holy Spirit <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>spoke, This is
my beloved Son, <i>in</i> whom I am well pleased.&nbsp; This is
my beloved Son, <i>with</i> whom I am well pleased.&nbsp; So says
St. Matthew and St. Mark.&nbsp; God has chosen us in Christ, this
is the Father&rsquo;s sealing; but the Holy Spirit in us, is the
Spirit&rsquo;s seal, and every gracious look, intercourse, and
holy frame, is the sealing work.&nbsp; This is not faith, but it
is the enjoyment of the object we do believe in.&nbsp; Faith is a
radical principle, and always abides in the heart: But after ye
believed ye were sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.&nbsp; This
sealing is the sensible enjoyment of the promised good.&nbsp; I
beg dear Mrs. H&mdash; to notice this.&nbsp; A little sacred
comfort arising from believing, hoping, and trusting in the
finished work of Christ, is also the sealing work; and, perhaps,
in the closing scene of life, when she draws near to death, this
will be more blessedly enjoyed&mdash;For my people shall be
satisfied with my goodness saith the Lord.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">the Same</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p>How gracious is the Lord: when I cannot believe, still
<i>he</i> abideth faithful&mdash;Oh! for an heart to love him,
and to adore him; but though I have often rebelled, yet, how
gracious and faithful he still continues towards me&mdash;surely
faithfulness is the girdle of his reins.&nbsp; This is the girdle
for faith to lay hold of.&nbsp; My faith has only to do with his
promises, the <i>whens</i>, the <i>wheres</i>, and the
<i>hows</i>; this is the Lord&rsquo;s work, and not mine.&nbsp; I
wish above all things for an increase of faith, of hope, and
love; the sweetest is love: but though I have so sweetly felt
this lately, it is now suspended, yet I hope it will
return.&nbsp; I am now in my old place, a poor, vile, guilty
creature, at the feet of Jesus, pleading his work again; and
looking now, <i>not</i> at what I feel, but at the satisfaction
of Christ, with which the Father is everlastingly well
pleased.&nbsp; Here I rest, till love is felt again; my desire is
to him, and to the remembrance of his name.&nbsp; Sin works,
Satan is busy, but grace still reigns.&nbsp; Thus we see that
grace has yet the honor of the field.&nbsp; We have not run back,
though we have often been down, the Lord raises us up again, and
this motto <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>is our privilege, &ldquo;I shall arise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh!
what a mercy, greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the
world.&nbsp; I have cause to be thankful to the Lord that he has
thus far led me; but the Devil, at times, almost drives me
distracted with the carking cares of what will happen to
me.&nbsp; Oh! lay my case before God, that I may have power to
cast this burthen on the Lord.&nbsp; I wish I could get over it;
yet my fears may be a good sign, better fear than to presume, or
grow careless.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Jan.</i>

<p>To <span class="smcap">the Same</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p>I hope you are all well in health.&nbsp; I have been poorly in
body and mind, but have been supported; <i>his</i> left hand I
found was under my head, but I wanted his right hand to embrace
me; the one is daily manifested, and the other is always wanted,
though but seldom felt.&nbsp; Yet he has embraced us, and Solomon
says, there is a time to embrace, and there is a time to refrain
from embracing.&nbsp; Christ received us to the glory of God in
the eternal covenant.&nbsp; The Father draws us to Christ, by <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>giving us to
feel our sinful state, our weakness and wants; and then by
setting before us his dear Son in his ability and willingness to
save.&nbsp; In his light we see him, desire him, move in heart
after him, and long for a smile of his approbation&mdash;to feel
it, and enjoy it, knowing that eternal life is in it.&nbsp; These
workings of the mind are often attended with fears, bondage,
doubts, and misgivings, and these rise as hope gets down; but as
faith gathers strength, so we rise above these doubts.&nbsp; This
has been my experience for many years, and I have now a good
opportunity of watching it.&nbsp; Some, indeed, get to land upon
the broad planks of the promises, and sensible manifestations of
divine love; but myself, and many more, will arrive as safe home,
only by getting hold of a few scattered truths, which we love and
embrace.&nbsp; Receive the truth, and the truth shall make you
free.&nbsp; And one truth is&mdash;I have blotted out as a thick
cloud thy sins.&mdash;We are all much tried, but it is our
appointed lot&mdash;discouraged because of the way.&nbsp; And are
these the blessings we expect?&nbsp; Is this the lot of
God&rsquo;s elect?&nbsp; Yes; this lot is cast into the lap, but
the whole disposing is of the Lord.&mdash;Let this note be read
to dear Mrs. H.&nbsp; Grace be with you all.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">the Same</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p>When you have read these letters, be so kind as to send one to
the Post Office, and the other, if you could call on Mrs.
L&mdash;, she would take it kind, as she is indisposed.&nbsp; She
was confined many weeks, and no one in the Church knew it, or
else they would have visited her.&nbsp; I wish I was able, but
even then I should feel no desire, except the Lord gave it
me.&nbsp; When we are in bondage of spirit, the heart is
contracted, and we can feel for no one but ourselves; but when
love operates, and keeps the heart open, we can then sympathize
with the Lord&rsquo;s afflicted ones; our hearts are enlarged to
them, to their Lord, and to the truth as it is in Jesus.&nbsp; As
these sweet sensations of love are felt, we melt and mourn.&nbsp;
These are the sweetest moments of my life, and many such I have
had these three weeks past.&nbsp; These cause me songs in the
house of my pilgrimage, yet I cannot sing, I can only look on,
and wonder, while the Angel does marvellously before me.&nbsp; I
am but low in body, and a sweet lowness of mind, and here I am
most safe: I beg for the increase of it, but I am fearful of
losing it, knowing that the Son <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of Man is at times taken away: then do
we fast in those days.&nbsp; But we are getting home&mdash;happy
meeting by and by&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There may I meet my sincere friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the ransom&rsquo;d throng;<br />
Where love and friendship have no end,<br />

<p>To the <span class="smcap">Same</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p>I hope your faith is fixed upon, and growing into, a most
divine acquaintance with the <i>three</i> grand Favors the gospel
holds out to you; each adorable Person in the ever adorable
Trinity, proclaiming, I am thy God: and this Favor seen through a
fourth, even the human nature of Christ; while pardon,
justification, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, also shine
through the word in your mind: these also producing love, wonder,
and praise; and these opposed by the world, the flesh, and the
devil, often stirring up fear, rebellion, and <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>ingratitude,
till we are favored again with fresh power, fresh views, and
fresh strength; encouraging and confirming faith, hope, and
patience, and working in prayer, hearing, and reading, till we
find it sweet to talk, meditate, and praise.&nbsp; Soon we shall
see three wonders; Christ in person, the angels in light, and the
glorified Church of the redeemed in full dress.&nbsp; We are in
our dishabille at present; the world knoweth us not, because it
doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we shall be like
<i>him</i>, as sure as we love him now.&nbsp; Do tell Mrs. H.
this glory is for them that wait for him, them that trust in him,
and them who love his various visits; and I am sure this will
encourage her.&nbsp; Mark it: <i>those who hope in his mercy</i>;
and that mercy is Christ.</p>

<h2>LETTER VI.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Dec.</i>
19, 1817.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. E.</p>
<p>When the dear apostles of old wrote their epistles to the
churches, after having stated the glory and preciousness of
Christ, they generally mentioned some name of the adorable
Father, as suited to that Church to whom they wrote.&nbsp; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>When Peter
addressed the churches scattered abroad, during the persecution
under the pagan emperors, he mentioned the glorious character of
God, as the God of all grace&mdash;<i>all</i> grace which they
could need.&mdash;Paul mentions to one church, the God of hope;
to another, the God of patience, and the God of all
consolation.&nbsp; These titles are exceedingly precious; and as
they are suited to the churches of old, they are handed down to
us, as they suit us now; and indeed whatever precious character
the Lord bears, it is in mercy to us&mdash;these are not empty
titles, but very important parts of that work, undertaken by the
adorable Trinity ere time began.&nbsp; It is surprising grace
that God should ever go forth in creature acts of love to
us&mdash;that he should pass by others&mdash;that he should
occupy his thoughts about us, who are but mere worms, clods of
earth.&nbsp; This is wonderful, that he should love us, though
fallen, polluted, distant, and awfully rebellious&mdash;that he
should ever visit, abide, and dwell with us: this is surprising
grace, stupendous mercy indeed, that the Lord should ever send a
promise to the heart, and make that promise good to such
unbelieving, unworthy beings.&nbsp; These things will, no doubt,
astonish the saints of God in glory for ever.&nbsp; O, that they
had better effect upon our hearts! and the reason why they have
not, is owing to the weakness of our faith; and faith is weakened
as the word of God, the throne of God, and the people <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of God are
neglected.&nbsp; As sin is winked at, and lies upon the mind
almost unseen, and, of course, unlamented&mdash;this weakens
precious faith.&nbsp; May the Lord keep up those two useful
agents in our souls, <i>Watchful</i> and <i>All-prayer</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to myself, I am kept passive in my Lord&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; I sensibly feel my situation; I am certainly very
low, but I have many mercies.&nbsp; My faith and confidence
increases in the Lord&rsquo;s designs, at least, in the
<i>end</i> designed; and when I am tried <i>enough</i>, I shall
come forth as gold.&nbsp; Jesus is a refiner and purifyer; his
dear people are compared to gold and silver&mdash;if they were
only wooden vessels, they would be burnt with the fire of
tribulation; but then, though they cannot be consumed, the
apostle intimates their works&mdash;some hay, straw, and
stubble&mdash;must be burnt, though himself shall be saved, yet
so as by fire.</p>

VII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>June</i> 14, 1819.</p>
<p>Mrs. E.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR FRIEND,</span></p>
<p>I trust you are better in health than you was; I feel very
anxious about you both; I pray God to spare you, to see his good
hand of grace toward me; and that he has heard many prayers on my
behalf, although he has not heard them in the way I requested;
but though the Lord often changes his promise, yet, he never
breaks his promise.&nbsp; He often changes the promise of a
temporal blessing into a spiritual good; but he never changes his
mind nor falsifies his word&mdash;he is the only faithful Friend
on whom we can rely; all others are like glasses, they are to be
used, but no weight to be put upon them.&nbsp; Hence the command,
Trust ye not in a friend; lean not too heavy, nor build upon
glass.&nbsp; This blessing is the gift of God, it is grace given
to the friend; and it is worthy of observation, that a
disposition to act friendly, is from God, and the befriended
should look to Jesus through the friend, as Christ shines through
them.&nbsp; And this is evidenced by the effects produced,
because it draws up the mind to the Saviour in a way of gratitude
and wonder, love and praise.&nbsp; I will magnify the Lord with a
song.&nbsp; The <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>shall please the Lord better than a bullock that hath
horns and hoofs.&nbsp; This is the way the Lord deals, at times,
with me; when particularly sensible of sin, I confess,
supplicate, plead, and submit; if grief overflow, I pray, read
much, and think; and when I am favored with the least glimpse of
his face, or a sensation of his love, or a little life in my
spirit, then I praise, love, adore, and offer up the sacrifice of
thanksgiving&mdash;this is called the calves of the lips.</p>
<p>I have not written my thoughts on the subject we last
discoursed on, but shall by and by, God willing.&nbsp; I have
been much grieved lately that Mr. &mdash; has made use of such
warm expressions in the pulpit, concerning the decrees of
God.&nbsp; What he has asserted are undoubted truths, but I
object to the <i>manner</i> in which they are stated.&nbsp; I
have no objection to the preaching these awful and sublime
subjects, but it requires a man of <i>some</i> wisdom to state
them properly, or else the subject may be rendered disgustful,
even to believers themselves.&nbsp; God has chosen his people in
Christ before the world began: this is a truth worthy of our
deepest regard; that the Lord should cause millions and millions
of beings, angels and men, to rise in his infinite mind, and out
of them to select a people for himself, to the glory of his own
name, and, as a Sovereign, to display upon them the riches of his
grace&mdash;this <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>was the favour shewed them, and this favour is called
<i>grace</i>, electing sovereign grace, because he passed the
rest by, he did not confer on them this favour.&nbsp; No reason
can be assigned for this, but his own sovereign good-will.&nbsp;
The rest he passed by; he did not choose them to damn them, nor
predestinate them to be damned, nor make them on purpose to damn
them; that was not the business; he passed them by in reference
to his act, but he chose the rest, both angels and men, in the
dear Covenant Head, and fixed them, standing most secure in
Christ, before they fell.&nbsp; Those whom the Lord passed by,
stood in Adam only; here they sinned, fell, and became guilty: as
they grow up, they evidence God has passed them by, as they live
and die regardless of God, ignorant of the Saviour, and heart
enemies to him; but as God did not choose the elect for any
foreseen good in them, or done by them, so neither did he pass by
the rest because they would be so vile, but he chose the one in
the riches of his grace, and passed by the other in his divine
sovereignty.&nbsp; Mark&mdash;he does not damn them because he is
a Sovereign, and has a right to do it; No, he only passed by them
as a Sovereign, and he punishes them because they hate him, and
have so awfully signed against him, so that our God is holy,
gracious, sovereign, and just.</p>
<p>I thought it acceptable to you, to drop you <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>this line, to
state the simple truth as it is in scripture; a subject that
puzzled me for many years, and which has still a mystery in it
that we cannot comprehend; yet there is enough revealed to faith
to receive, admire, and adore.&nbsp; And as to the damnation of
infants, which Mr. &mdash; advanced last Sunday, the scriptures
are silent about it; nor do I think it forms any part of the
gospel which Jesus and Paul preached.&nbsp; We have nothing to do
with it.&nbsp; Where the bible has no mouth, we ought to have no
ears.&nbsp; I am of opinion that children are saved, but I have
no positive scripture for it&mdash;as the glories of heaven are
rather described by negatives, what they are not, so the
salvation of children is by a negative also, where they are not;
for in the account of those that are lost, and in hell now, and
will be punished there, we read nothing of children.&nbsp; Our
dear friend Mr. Fosset, wishes me to write on these subjects, at
the next church meeting, to set this matter at rest a little, by
explaining the subject in my simple, humble manner.&nbsp; What a
mercy the Lord has not passed us by, as he might have done; and
as an evidence he loves us, he has given us some taste of that
love, and created his fear in our hearts.</p>

VIII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>Sept.</i>
15, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>, Mr. C.</p>
<p>I thank you kindly for the loan of books.&nbsp; I return you
the Pamphlet written by Mr. Gadsby.&nbsp; I quite agree with him
in his views of the Moral Law, which is commonly termed so, but
which the Apostle stiles <i>spiritual</i>.&nbsp; I consider the
Gospel of the grace of God, the Father&rsquo;s will to us, in
Christ Jesus, containing <i>Promises</i>, <i>Declarations of
Mercy</i>, <i>Imitations</i>, <i>Precepts</i>, <i>and
Exhortations</i>, to be the only, and all-sufficient Rule of a
Christian.&nbsp; These are not in opposition to the holy Law of
God, but they far excel it in glory, and as many as walk
according to this Rule, peace be on them.&nbsp; Christ is our
King and our Law-giver, he has fulfilled the Law for his Church,
brought in an everlasting righteousness for our justification; he
has put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, and he lives a life
of mediation for all who come to God through him.&nbsp; The Holy
Spirit illuminates the mind; reveals pardon to the conscience;
and sheds abroad the love of God in the heart, plants his fear in
the soul, and enables us to take the will of God for our Rule, as
it is expressed in the Gospel.&mdash;This is our rule of walk,
conduct, and conversation&mdash;the Lord help us to walk in this
light, as God is in the light.&nbsp; But I think it is cruel for
any Preacher or Author, who professes to be a leader of
God&rsquo;s people, to send them to the Law, in <i>any sense
whatever</i>.&nbsp; Every worldling and proud Pharisee should be
sent there, till they are taught their need of Christ.&nbsp; But
an humble, regenerate person, should always be directed to the
Lord Jesus, to the throne of grace, and to the glorious Gospel of
grace.&nbsp; None but <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>worldly Wisemen will ever direct
either a burthened Pilgrim, or a consistent believer, to the
Law.&nbsp; John Bunyan met with such a director, but what his
feelings were he tells you: First, he forsook the advice: of the
Gospel Minister, <i>Evangelist</i>, who gave him this direction,
<i>Look unto Jesus</i>.&nbsp; Secondly, He tried to raise a
prejudice in his mind against the Ministers who preach free
grace.&nbsp; Thirdly, He directed him to go by the high hill that
he pointed to.&nbsp; This is the way that seemeth right to a man,
but it is falling from grace: the spirit of bondage began to work
on his mind; his fears of the curse of this broken Covenant
increased; his guilt was deeper felt, because he was out of the
way.&nbsp; A sense of God&rsquo;s anger flashed on his spirit,
and the dread of damnation overcame him.&nbsp; He quaked for
fear.&nbsp; This is coming to Mount Sinai indeed, and this is all
the Law can do, viz. Convince and condemn&mdash;and these
feelings, more or less, attend those who are seeking to the Law
for life, hope, peace, and salvation; or that cleave to it in
<i>any sense whatever</i>: for what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them that are under it, whether they are in a
profession or out of it; and as many as are of the works of the
law, are under the curse of it&mdash;but we are redeemed from
that broken covenant, that we should serve the Lord Jesus in the
newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the
letter.&nbsp; But do read what Evangelist says of such Law
Preachers, and Directors, in his conversation with the Pilgrim,
when he met him near Mr. Legality&rsquo;s House.</p>
<p>May you and I walk in Christ, die to sin, and live more to
God.&mdash;Kind respects to Mrs. C. and Brother.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Achor&rsquo;s Vale</i>,
<i>May</i> 6, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>, Miss <span
class="smcap">Braes</span>,</p>
<p>History relates a poor aged man, who had once been serviceable
to his country, and was condemned by a Tyrant to be starved to
death in prison.&nbsp; All were astonished that he did not die,
seeing no food was brought to him; but it was found afterwards
that his married daughter visited him twice a day, and gave him
suck from her own breast.&nbsp; This is an instance of filial
affection.&nbsp; You have acted almost as kind, in its degree, to
me; and with your dear aunt, you have often soothed my sorrows
with the milk of human kindness.&nbsp; May my Lord reward it
another day.&nbsp; You have heard my poor feeble sermons with
pleasure, especially when I have been enabled to point out the
beauties, and glories of the <i>Friend</i> of guilty man.&nbsp; I
hope I am only learning better how to extol and magnify the
grace, the love, the person, and work of <i>him</i>, who, to a
grace-taught eye, is fairer than the children of men.&nbsp; I
have, indeed, fell into a place where two seas meet&mdash;the
malice of Satan and the power of man; yet, through grace, and
when it is well with me, I have this confidence, <i>I shall
arise</i>; but how, and when, I leave it with God.&nbsp; I am at
times troubled about it, but at other times I can cast that
burden on the Lord.&nbsp; I wish it laid in my power to write
something to you of the dear Saviour, that would lead you to
admire and adore him.&nbsp; I have said a little about him, but,
alas, it was little indeed.&nbsp; He is the bright Sun in the
firmament of heaven, all the millions of angels and spirits of
just men who are now in glory, look upon him with wonder and
delight; and while they gaze, he fills them with joy, with peace,
with love, and with the most solid satisfaction.&nbsp; They
wondered at his <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>love when on earth, that he should ever bleed and
agonize, sigh and die for them; but, what must they think now
they see him in his full glory?</p>
<blockquote><p>And <i>now</i> they range the heavenly plains,<br
/>
And sing <i>his</i> love in sweetest strains;<br />
Or, overwhelm&rsquo;d with rapture sweet,<br />
Sink down, adoring at his feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because <i>he</i> is so glorious, so beautiful, so lovely, and
so kind.&nbsp; He saw what poor guilty creatures we should be,
condemned to eternal misery and woe.&nbsp; <i>He</i> knew we
could not help ourselves out of this state.&nbsp; <i>He</i> knew
God was just in condemning us, and he knew that God, as an
unchangeable Being, could not alter his oath, As I live, the soul
that sinneth shall die!&nbsp; We had broken his Law; we were born
in sin; we went astray from infancy, and must have strayed into
everlasting darkness, but,</p>
<blockquote><p>With pitying eye the Prince of Peace,<br />
Beheld our helpless grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>He</i> took our nature, engaged to fulfil the Law we had
broken, and pay the dreadful debt of suffering.&nbsp; This
<i>he</i> did heartily for us, and is now in glory, pleading the
virtue of that work, and receiving all that come to God by
<i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Sing, oh ye heavens, Jesus hath done it, and done it, I trust,
for my dear young Friend, to whom I write with pleasure.&nbsp;
Need I say to you that you stand in need of this Saviour?&nbsp; I
hope you are in a little measure convinced of it, and at times,
when no eye can see you but the Saviour&rsquo;s, you send up many
an humble wish, fervent desires, and earnest breathings, that the
ever-blessed Spirit would teach you Christ, and shew you that
your sins are pardoned, that your interest is sure, and that the
dear Lord thought <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>upon <i>you</i> when <i>he</i> engaged to die for
sinners&mdash;that <i>he</i> thought upon you when he entered
into the garden of sorrow, and when <i>he</i> said, It is
finished!&nbsp; Do often, secretly lift up your heart to
<i>him</i>, saying, Lord shew me that thou lovest me.&nbsp; This
is done by the Spirit and by the Word.&nbsp; May <i>he</i> be
very precious to you; and do remember <i>he</i> hath said, They
that seek <i>me</i> shall find me.&nbsp; Blessed is she that
believeth, for there shall be a performance of those things that
are told her from the Lord.</p>
<p>And now do accept my sincerest thanks for your affectionate
kindness.</p>

<h2>LETTER X.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>May</i>
16, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>, Mrs. <span
class="smcap">Harris</span>,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear of your indisposition, but hope also to
hear soon of your recovery.&nbsp; I take this opportunity of
acknowledging how much I feel indebted to you for your long
concern for my best interest, and your grief for my trials; but I
think God has given you many tokens of my future good, by many
gracious impressions on your mind in your sleeping hours, and I
trust we shall not be mistaken in them, although we are apt to
construe such impressions to mere temporal advantages, just as
the Apostles did of our dear Lord&rsquo;s kingdom and government;
they all thought he was come to set up a temporal kingdom, but
when they were filled with the Holy Spirit they understood the
subject better.&nbsp; This world is not our rest, we <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>are not born
merely to pass our lives in this, but to be looking out for a
better and more enduring home: yet, alas, how prone are we to fix
our tents here, in this world of uncertainty and trouble.&nbsp; I
trust my dear friend has a little hope of a better world.&nbsp;
You have often heard of an eternal glory, and I am sure it will
be a heaven worth dying for.&nbsp; Many of the people of the
world rush into wars and bloodshed, the ruins of countries and
the distress of nations, merely to get a great name, and that it
might be said they died honorably in the field of battle.&nbsp;
Poor deluded creatures, this was not worth dying for; honour and
fame is but a noise, a vapour, a puff, and a breath.&nbsp; But we
want to die to obtain a glorious eternity, to see the dear
Saviour, to be with him, and to be like him; to see him with our
enlightened understandings, till the last trumpet shall sound,
and our bodies be raised from the dead, strong, beautiful, and
glorious, and the soul and body meet again with rapture, to be
filled with the joy of the Lord, to hear the welcome sentence of
the dear Redeemer, and see him smile on us, creating our heaven,
and delighting us with his love; opening our minds to receive the
knowledge of God in his glorious persons, the greatness of his
grace, the displays of his wisdom and power&mdash;his truth,
condescension, faithfulness, and mercy in our eternal
salvation.</p>
<p>I trust my dear kind Friend can say she humbly desires only
Christ and an interest in him, to know that her sins are pardoned
by him, and that she lives in the tenderest affections of his
heart.&nbsp; The scriptures declare that you do live there, but
you want to feel it for yourself; yet, I hope you can say, from
what little you do know, you depend upon Christ as God-Man and
Mediator, upon his most blessed work, as your acceptance with the
Father, only you want the gracious Holy Spirit to shew you so
much of Christ as to cause you to love <i>him</i> above all
things, and to give you the clearest assurance of his love to
you.&nbsp; <i>Do take notice</i>.&nbsp; <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>This little
knowledge you have of <i>him</i>, and this desire after
<i>him</i>, this humble dependence upon <i>him</i>, and
renouncing all others, is really believing in <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless thee and keep thee, be your leader, guide,
and comfort.&nbsp; Kind love to your Niece, and all enquiring
friends and acquaintance.&mdash;I must conclude this letter, with
some Remarks I have met with on the very great difference between
an <i>Acquaintance</i> and a <i>Friend</i>.</p>

Points to my Father&rsquo;s house above.</p>

25, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>, I. R. <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>.</p>
<p>I am ashamed I have been so dilatory in answering your kind
letter of the 10th instant.&nbsp; I read it with most exquisite
delight.&nbsp; I intended a very long epistle for you, but I must
still remain that in your debt, which I will faithfully pay the
earliest opportunity.&nbsp; Yesterday I was just sitting down to
drop you a line, but was suddenly surprized to hear of your
indisposition.&nbsp; I fear your daily vexations have hurt your
nervous system, and distressed your mind; nor have you much power
to bear them&mdash;we all want strength to endure
tribulation.&nbsp; We want power to stand in the evil day, that
we may not fall before it.&nbsp; I have often been pleased,
edified, and comforted with that very precious Promise, xliii.
Isa.&nbsp; &ldquo;When thou passest through the fire, thou shalt
not be burned; when thou passest through the waters, they shall
not overflow thee, for I am with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; I trust this
promise will be fulfilled in our experience <i>till</i> death,
and <i>in</i> death.&nbsp; I feel anxious about your health of
body.&nbsp; I judge your feelings.&nbsp; I know your state of
mind.&nbsp; We need Divine keeping in every thing we do, and in
every step we take.&nbsp; Hence, David prayed: Preserve me, O
God, for in thee do I put my trust.&nbsp; Leave me not
destitute.&nbsp; Does not this prayer suit you well? it does
me.&nbsp; Yet I feel happy the Lord is leading you to see the
vanity of all things below the stars; the emptiness of the
creature, the sin of your nature, in hewing out cisterns, yea,
broken cisterns, that can hold, retain, no water.&nbsp; No sooner
are creature comforts in, but they run out again.&nbsp; Yet,
alas, how awful for mankind to forsake the living <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>fountain
which never will be exhausted, or run dry!&nbsp; The adorable
Trinity in unity, is that fountain, each glorious person is so
represented, because they are equal in power, majesty, glory, and
goodness.&nbsp; God is love, and this glorious God-head includes
the three Holy Ones.&nbsp; What a mercy for us, <i>they</i>
divinely condescended to enter into covenant about us, such
hell-deserving sinners as we are, and in the prospect of our
miseries, made ample provision for us, that we might be infinite
gainers by the fall, and God for ever glorified in that great
business of redemption and grace.&mdash;In this glorious covenant
our sins were made over to Christ, and his righteousness made
over to us.&nbsp; This was secured by the promise, and the oath
of God; confirmed by the blood of the dear Saviour; made known in
the Gospel, and brought to the faith of an humble believer.&nbsp;
After the sense and assurance of this blessing, we being first
convinced of sin, and fearing God&rsquo;s wrath, the day of
death, the last judgment and eternity, we doubt, fear, pray,
hope, aspire, desire, long, and then grow careless, lukewarm,
indifferent, dead, till guilt is felt again, or trouble arises,
or affliction comes on; then we get alarmed, quickened, and
anxious again to read our title clear, to see the interest Christ
has in us, and the interest we have in <i>him</i>; to know that
our sins are forgiven us, that God is at peace with us, that the
law is magnified, sin put away, a door open in heaven that no sin
in future can shut; death left stingless, judgment not at all
dreaded, because we shall see <i>him</i> whom we <i>adore</i>,
<i>admire</i>, and <i>love</i>; we shall be made like <i>him</i>,
we shall get rid of sin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sin, our worst enemy before,<br />
Shall vex our eyes and souls no more;<br />
But every power find sweet employ<br />
In Christ&rsquo;s eternal world of joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg the Lord, the Holy Spirit, to give you supernatural
ideas of Christ, so as to endear <i>him</i> to your heart, and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>make you long
to tell of <i>his name</i> and fame; to make you wise; to be as
wise as Paul, and as eloquent as Apollos; that you might point
forth the Divine excellencies of Jesus to poor sinners.&nbsp; I
trust your life will be spared for this purpose, it is the only
thing worth living for.&nbsp; Christ is the darling of the
Father, and the grand object of the Spirit&rsquo;s glorification:
angels adore <i>him</i>, saints admire <i>him</i>, and in our
poor feeble way, oh that we could love <i>him</i> with every
power and passion, with every member and faculty of body, soul
and spirit.&nbsp; May this instrument of ten strings sweetly
sound <i>his</i> dear fame.&nbsp; The most painful lesson we have
to learn, is the evil of our hearts, the malice of the devil, the
weakness of our own arm, and our utter impossibility to do any
one good thing without Christ: separated from <i>him</i>, we can
do nothing, no more than a dead branch can grow, that is cut off
and thrown aside.&nbsp; The nature, extent, and spirituality of
the law, and our condemnation by it, the person, the glory, and
work of Christ, as the head of the church, and the Saviour of the
body.&nbsp; This is the main subject, and the various displays of
the offices of God, the Holy Spirit, as the glorifier of
Christ.&nbsp; This subject is the Gospel itself, and the longer I
live, the more blessed I see this truth.&nbsp; The Son of man is
come to save that which was lost.&nbsp; This is an encouragement
to my soul, and the very basis of my hope.&nbsp; Here alone is
the way of access to God, to the Throne, and to Heaven.&nbsp; May
the Spirit sanctify, and bless you; bear testimony with your
spirit, that you are a child of God.&nbsp; This will be spiritual
health in bodily sickness; this will light life in death, and
gild the gloomy horrors of the tomb, as the celebrated Dr. Young
says, and with which I conclude my epistle.</p>
<blockquote><p>Religion! thou the soul of happiness,<br />
And, groaning Calvary, of thee: there shine<br />
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The
noblest truths: there strongest motives sting:<br />
There sacred violence assaults the soul;<br />
There nothing but compulsion is forborne.<br />
Can love allure us? or can terror awe?<br />
He weeps!&mdash;the falling drop puts out the sun.<br />
He sigh!&mdash;the sigh earth&rsquo;s deep foundation shakes.<br
/>
If in <i>his</i> love so terrible, what then<br />
<i>His</i> wrath inflam&rsquo;d?&nbsp; <i>His</i> tenderness on
fire?<br />
Like soft, smooth oil, out-blazing other fires?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pray do let me know how you are in health as soon as you
can.&mdash;Kind love to Mrs. R. wishing you a healthy body and a
prosperous soul.</p>

<p>To I. R. <span class="smcap">Esq</span>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p>I am truly happy to hear that the Lord has restored you again
in some measure to health.&nbsp; I was much affected at the news
of your sudden indisposition, and knew not what was the will of
God concerning you, but through mercy, I trust your spared life
is for the glory of God, and will be a means of your increasing
in knowledge, that your mind may be better prepared for the
special Service of God, and that you may be ready to take your <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>flight as
soon as the <i>Lord</i>, the <i>Master</i> cometh and calleth for
you.&nbsp; Every attack of the constitution is a messenger sent
to let us know our frailty: these tabernacles of flesh are but
weak, and hang on a precarious thread; our bones are the
<i>stakes</i>, the <i>cords</i> are the sinews, and the
<i>breath</i> is the main pillar.&nbsp; Great God, on what a
slender thread hangs everlasting things; the eternal state of all
the dead hangs on such feeble strings.</p>
<p>God has laid an everlasting foundation for <i>his</i> dear
people in the everlasting covenant; the effect of <i>his</i>
everlasting love, the profound depth of <i>his</i> infinite
wisdom, which has secured an everlasting salvation, by an
everlasting righteousness, which will be to the everlasting
praise of Jehovah, and to the everlasting joy of <i>his</i> dear
church.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then at <i>his</i> throne our crowns we&rsquo;ll
cast,<br />
And shout, I am saved, I am saved at last!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your indisposition, and indeed every other calamity is as that
messenger of whom the prophet Elisha gave orders to notice, Look,
as when the messenger cometh, hold him fast, and shut to the
door, is not the sound of his master&rsquo;s feet behind?&nbsp;
So may we detain every message of sorrow.&nbsp; Ask the question,
Why is this sent me? what does he say from his master?&nbsp; But
why ask this? the sound of Christ is heard, Behold, I come
quickly.&nbsp; Our deep concern of soul, and every conviction of
sin, every fear of death, judgment, and eternity should be
entertained, thought over, and made use of, to go to God with,
and entreat the manifestation of pardoning love and mercy.&nbsp;
Hence, <i>he</i> has promised to be found of them that seek
<i>him</i>, to be found as a God in Christ, in whom all fulness
dwells, and having all the blessings of an everlasting covenant
to bestow upon the heirs of promise.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span><i>He</i>
giveth to them just as they need; but these blessings are only
given to the poor and helpless, the lost, the guilty, and the
vile, and till this is the case with us, we can never be in
earnest about Christ, and <i>his</i> Salvation.&nbsp; Wretches
that feel what help they need, will bless the helping hand; and
till the Saviour puts forth <i>his</i> power, we can do no more
than the mariners did with Jonah aboard; the men rowed hard to
bring it to land, but the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
against them.&nbsp; Christ is the only one who can still the
tempest of a distressed mind, and bring us on our knees,
exclaiming, What manner of <i>man</i> is this, that even the
winds and sea obey <i>him</i>.&nbsp; This is a comfort to me in
my most dreary prospects.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>London</i>, <i>September</i> 10,
1820.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My much beloved Friend</span>, I. R. <span
class="smcap">Esq</span>.</p>
<p>Mrs. P. did me the honor to call on me last night with the
very painful news of the departure of your dear John.&nbsp; A
variety of serious ideas flowed into my mind upon hearing of your
affecting and serious loss.&nbsp; I knew how much you loved him,
how dear he was to you both; I knew how very engaging he had
become; I considered your feelings on the occasion, nor was I
without my fears, lest you should reflect on yourselves in taking
him so long a journey.&nbsp; I have also pictured to myself your
absence from the little pious society of friends amongst us, your
large and venerable house.&nbsp; Recent death of an aged <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>parent, with
none but strangers around you, and a variety of circumstances
beside; these, yes, these things dwell on my mind, and have led
me to trouble you with a line on the sad occasion.&nbsp; I hope
an apology for intrusion is needless.&nbsp; I write not to
<i>inform</i> my beloved friends, but only to <i>remind</i> them,
that every event is absolutely decreed by a God of infinite
wisdom; not a stroke of affliction, nor a shaft of death can
possibly touch, but by Divine appointment.&nbsp; The
<i>nature</i>, the <i>kind</i>, the <i>time</i>, the <i>age</i>,
the <i>place</i> were all arranged in the unerring purposes of
God.&nbsp; It was decreed the dear dear boy should be taken to B.
Hall, <i>there</i> the Lord would send for him.&nbsp; He has sent
for his own: the Lord had the greatest right to him, he was,
indeed, lent to his affectionate parents, but he is demanded back
again; he was the object of his heavenly father&rsquo;s love, he
was the property of Jesus, and he must be brought home to his
house, by his holy angels.&nbsp; Death indeed is very terrible to
our natures, it takes away the darlings of our hearts, and the
desire of our eyes, but it has transmitted yours to the enjoyment
of God in human nature: this is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s
design in this providence, and with holy joy you will one day
say, <i>He</i> has done all things well.&nbsp; The dear boy, like
Abraham in his conversion, has left his native country, and gone
into the eternal inheritance, which God has prepared for him, and
which he never saw or sought before.&nbsp; Like Jacob, he at the
command of his God, has returned to his father&rsquo;s house, and
his own spiritual and angelic kindred: like the Israelites,
though his journey was short, God opened a passage through the
garden of death: his little journey is ended, he sets in peace,
<i>it is well</i>.&nbsp; Farewell, my dear-little fellow, I shall
kiss thy little lips or press thy little cheeks no more! no, no,
the painful task is assigned to thy dear parents, to see thee
taken from their arms, and from their house, to the solemn tomb,
the silent, the dark, the cold, the dreary receptacle for
suffering <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>mortality.&nbsp; Happy voyager, how short thy passage on
the sea of this tribulated world; how short thy stay, how swift
thy flight; but what thy surprize to enter into another state of
love, holiness, joy, and glory; every little power expanded, and
the soul plunged in a moment into a sea of bliss: what a glorious
transition, what a surprize, and perhaps the first object it saw,
was its little sister at the portals of bliss, waiting to welcome
him home, although unknown before, yet now known to each other
for ever.&nbsp; Methinks I see them meet and clasp each other
with holy innocent joy, and if a thought could be indulged, or
received about their beloved parents: surely they converse
together about you: but hark, they speak to you! they bid you
weep not; (if ye loved us ye would rejoice we are gone to our
Father, and the world seeth us no more.&nbsp; Hallelujah.)</p>
<p>I hope dear Mrs. R. will be most divinely supported under this
bereavement.&nbsp; I trust the dear little one in London will be
restored to be a comfort, but dear John is this moment fresh in
my mind.&nbsp; I judge your feelings; I am sorry you are so far
distant from us.&nbsp; I have the departure of my own beloved
daughter still in mind, the thought often occurs: well, let us
look up, let us take courage, we shall bless God for their loss
another day; we are left to endure many a conflict, many a trial,
many a grief, but the soft hand of Jesus has wiped off the tears
from his little face: it is ours to suffer toil and grief, till
death transmits us, burdened and tired, grieved, and tried, to
that glory which never fades away; it is well for us that the
dear Redeemer has been through the territories of death and the
grave, that he has taken the sting of the one, and overcome the
other for us.&nbsp; May his love solace your mind; may his grace
reign in your hearts; may his power protect you, and his very
gracious presence cheer your souls; the separation is painful,
but it is short.&nbsp; Our days fly swiftly <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>away, the
night of death will come on; it may not be very distant, but
interested in Jesus, pardoned and justified, influenced, and led
by his spirit, we shall meet in a brighter, and better abode.</p>
<p>God bless you both together with his supporting hand.&nbsp; So
prays your sympathizing friend, and best wisher in Christ.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>,
<i>August</i> 13, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mrs</span>. M.</p>
<p>I trust you are as well in mind and body as you expect to be
in a time state.&nbsp; I have cause to bless God for all I have
experienced, even for the bitter path of sorrow.&nbsp; But I have
had much of the Lord&rsquo;s goodness pass before me, and
<i>he</i> has manifested his dear name to me, as the Lord, the
Lord God, gracious and merciful, abundant in goodness, in mercy,
and truth; and though <i>he</i> can by no means (of a
sinner&rsquo;s devising) clear the guilty, yet <i>he</i> has
devised a plan, in infinite wisdom, whereby <i>he</i> can be
just, and yet the justifier of the ungodly.&nbsp; And it is our
mercy that we are brought from all confidence in the flesh, while
a daily acquaintance with the depravity of our hearts, keeps us
from trusting in self; the troubles of life keep us from making
up our happiness in the world, and the hypocrisy of professors,
with the weakness of God&rsquo;s <i>own</i> children, keeps us
from looking to, and idolizing the creature; thus we tread the
same path which the pious prophet Micah did, when he wrote his
seventh chapter, and came to this <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>blessed conclusion, <i>Therefore</i>
will I look to the Lord: this is all that the blessed spirit aims
at in bringing us low in soul, in the church, and in the
world.&nbsp; My time flies fast; I dread to enter into the field
of battle again.&nbsp; I am weaker in myself than ever I was, but
perhaps the power of Christ will the more sensibly rest upon
me.&nbsp; I hope to return with the olive branch of peace, while
our adorable Noah opens the window, and puts forth his hand to
receive me into the ark.&nbsp; I should like to come to the
Lord&rsquo;s family loaded; I know they are a needy people, and
the Lord has provided many things for them: <i>he</i> keeps a
good table, though the family have not always an appetite to
enjoy the rich provisions of his house; but the ever-kind
householder has provisions suited to every one.&nbsp; I hope,
therefore, to bring with me a little of the sincere milk of the
word, for the children, that they may grow thereby, and some
solid meat for those who are strong: the fatted calf, the roasted
paschal lamb, without a bitten herb; an olive berry, from the
uppermost bough; three loaves, also some unleavened bread, and a
cake, baked under the tree.&nbsp; Some butter and neat honey from
the rock, with the honey comb.&nbsp; Some broiled fish, also out
of the sea of Tiberias; and as we may want a desert also, I hope
to bring some apples, some nuts, and almonds; a bunch of figs, to
take inwardly, or to make a plaister of, to lay on some sore
place.&nbsp; Some good grapes of Eshcol, and pomegranates, and
mandrakes; also a bottle of new wine, well refined.&nbsp; Some
rock water, clear as chrystal, from the well of Bethlehem; this
will be very cheering to some of the family.&nbsp; I hope also to
bring some very beautiful flowers; a lovely <i>rose</i>, without
a thorn; a remarkable <i>lily</i>, in full bloom, which grows in
certain vallies, and many other lovely flowers; some only in bud,
and some in full blossom: but I have not mentioned one-half the
good things in our master&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Let these suffice
at present.&nbsp; I only want ability to get things ready, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and then to
call the guests, and to deliver out the various portions, as they
are designed: but what do you think? though I am such a poor
servitor, yet my master takes the trouble to teach me himself,
and I never get scolded, without I act wrong, and am always
forgiven, though I am often shut up in the coal cellar, yet not
half so often as I deserve.&nbsp; About three years ago I sadly
neglected the kitchen, and the setting out the table: I grew very
careless, soiled my livery, and mingled even with the very
enemies of my master; this was very ungrateful.&nbsp; I lost my
place by it, and have been out of place this two years, yet my
master is very kind to me; <i>he</i> keeps me all the time I am
out of place, often sends to me, and has been several times to
see me.&nbsp; He has forgiven my folly, and I expect to be hired
again, about the ninth hour of the day, and then I shall bring
all the things I have mentioned, and a good many things
more.&nbsp; I expect a double honor upon me, for I hope to be
steward also, as well as cook and butler, for you must know we
have a charming wardrobe, and every one of his Benjamins are to
have five changes of raiment; some are to be worn every day, but
others only on court days, and public days.&nbsp; The outer one
is to be always kept white, and though bad fellows throw dirt on
it, yet we must not do so ourselves.&nbsp; What they throw on us
will not stick, but what we do, is sure to abide; this is very
remarkable.&nbsp; But I had almost forgot the music, a high
sounding organ, a harp of ten strings, a cymbal, a lute, a
violin, a tabret, and some silver trumpets, as a dance is
expected, xxxi. Jeremiah, ver. 4.&mdash;We have also got in my
master&rsquo;s house, some armour shoes, which look very
beautiful, and fit every ones feet in the family, and they are so
strong, that they are like iron and brass; there is a two-edged
sword, a battle-axe, a helmet, a shield, a breast plate, and a
bow with many precious arrows: thus you see how well we are
provided, and in order to pass away our <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>time
pleasantly, and for our comfort and instruction, we have a good
collection of books; histories, records, and ancient settlements,
and a will or testament: and will you believe it? I think
<i>your</i> name is in it.&nbsp; I have not time to tell you
about the ornaments, with the dresses, but there are ear-rings,
nose jewels, necklaces, bracelets, and all powders of the
merchant, and as to money, it has all the king&rsquo;s stamp upon
it.&nbsp; Some have but little, but others are well stored with
it; and there is but one piece that is ever lost, and when one of
the family has once had it, and lost it, a light is brought, the
house is swept, and no rest felt till it is found again.&nbsp;
May my dear friends be thus entertained in the banqueting house,
while the banner of love is displayed over their heads.</p>
<p>Grace be with you all.&mdash;Kind respects to your family.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your&rsquo;s,<br />
<b><i>Ruhamah</i></b>.</p>
<p>I once read an excellent letter on this subject, in the Gospel
Magazine.&nbsp; I wish you could procure it for me; it was
written many years ago.</p>
<h2>LETTER XV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>May</i>
2, 1819.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs</span>. F.</p>
<p>My heart feels truly grateful, that you remember me in my low
estate.&nbsp; There are thousands in a profession, who boast much
of their morality, and good works, and who may boast in the last
day, that they have done many wonderful works; but God lays this
to their <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>charge, they are not grieved for the afflictions of
Joseph!&nbsp; Such hypocrites are generally the most godly, where
there are the most lookers on.&nbsp; My deep tribulations have
tried many, and they have fled in the day of evil.&nbsp; What
would such persons do, should persecution ever visit our land;
and when it becomes a disgrace to profess religion?&nbsp; Nothing
but the love of Christ in the heart, and that love kept up, and
manifested under the sacred power of the holy Spirit, can enable
a person to go on in the midst of opposition, or in the summer of
prosperity; for it is a well known truth, that trials have slain
their thousands, but prosperity its ten thousands.&nbsp; I well
know <i>now</i>, what these words mean, &ldquo;It is my happiness
below, not to live without the cross:&rdquo; this cross galls the
old man of sin, but it is the means of the spiritual growth of
the new man.&nbsp; Hence, the afflicted king once said, Lord, by
these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my
spirit.&nbsp; Faith, if genuine has something to do in the
furnace; but when all is calm, she is inactive, and dull; hope is
languid, and love is not seen.&nbsp; I feel assured in my own, my
<i>right</i> mind, that this event <i>will</i> be for the glory
of God, and for much good to me, and to many: but enemies will no
doubt, always triumph, and say, Ah! there, so we would have it!
yet their joy is but as the crackling of thorns, under a pot; it
will not last long; only a blaze and a noise, and then it will
evaporate, like smoke.&nbsp; I hope I shall love God for this
rod, as well as for every other blessing.&nbsp; I never fully
understood the Psalmist till I came here, when he said, Thy rod,
and thy staff, they comfort me.&nbsp; Solomon explains it thus;
To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet, because this rod
is as much an evidence of our adoption, as any promise can
be.&nbsp; They shall all pass under the rod, and they will say at
last, our Jesus has done all things well.&nbsp; Ezekiel and John
were to eat a book; this was sweet in the mouth, but bitter in
the belly.&nbsp; So it is the case with us; the promise <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of fatherly
correction is sweet to faith, but bitter to the old man of
sin.&nbsp; Nature flinches, but grace strengthens the mind; bows
the will, and resigns the soul to the will of God.&nbsp;
<i>His</i> will and our wills are then in sweet unison; we are
agreed, and though we sigh, yet rebellion is kept under, by all
conquering grace; as a good woman once said, Though I groan I do
not grumble, yet she was sorely afflicted.</p>
<blockquote><p>But, why should I complain, of want, or
distress;<br />
Affliction or pain, <i>he</i> told me no less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is our mercy, the Saviour has borne the curse, and of
course took it out of all our sorrows; we have the cup of
tribulation, but the curse is gone; Jesus has taken it away, and
neither sin nor Satan, the world, or man can bring it back.&nbsp;
This was done by the great act of the Saviour&rsquo;s sorrows,
when <i>he</i> entered the garden of Gethsemane, and agonized
there, when the sorrows of his sacred soul were past all
description; and when he cried out on the cross, It is
finished!&nbsp; Yes, our dear Lord knew then the work was done,
in his putting away sin.&nbsp; <i>He</i> felt it was done, in his
soul, as <i>his</i> God and Father shone again, as well as the
sun did at three o&rsquo;clock the afternoon of his death: it was
<i>after</i> noon, indeed; the burning sun of God&rsquo;s Wrath
laid hot upon <i>him</i>, till justice was satisfied, and then
the indignation ceased for ever.&nbsp; This was
<i>afternoon</i>.&nbsp; I drop this hint only, but oh, that our
minds were more affected with his <i>sorrows than they
are</i>.&nbsp; <i>Think of these two lines</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Canst thou, ungrateful man, his torments
<i>see</i>?<br />
Nor shed one tear for him who shed his blood for <i>thee</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I pray God to grant my dear friend very sweet views <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>of her dear
Lord, on the work <i>he</i> has accomplished.&nbsp; May the holy
Spirit visit you, and shine upon your spirit, and help you to
believe in Jesus, and so to find <i>him</i> precious, that you
may know your sins are forgiven you.</p>

companion, and my friend.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>March</i>
26, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>, <span
class="smcap">Miss</span> D.,</p>
<p>What apology shall I make for my long delay, but lowness of
mind, and a tedious winter; and this, <i>with</i> you, I am sure
is quite apology enough.&nbsp; I write you, concerning the once
crucified, but now exalted <i>Jesus</i>.&nbsp; As it is the wish
of my soul, to live to fill up the cup of some poor
believer&rsquo;s consolation, though I am denied that privilege
at present, yet I hope to throw a mite into the Gospel treasury
for you, by sending a few imperfect lines, which I must beg you
to accept.&nbsp; O that I had but <i>the</i> wisdom of Solomon,
<i>the</i> piety of a David, <i>the</i> knowledge of a Paul,
<i>the</i> fervour of an Isaiah, <i>the</i> faith of an Abraham,
<i>the</i> love of a John, with <i>the</i> tearful affections of
a Mary, that I might speak good of his name.&nbsp; <i>Christ</i>
is all in all; <i>he</i> is the very glory in the centre of
Heaven, as the sun is in the universe.&nbsp; <i>He</i> is the joy
of Heaven; and though <i>he</i> is far off us, yet <i>he</i> has
promised ever to be with us.&nbsp; <i>He</i> is exactly suited to
us in all our wants, and the love of <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Jehovah is in no case so eminently
displayed, as in providing such a <i>Jesus</i> for us.&nbsp; So
great, so kind, so glorious, and yet so precious.&nbsp; We shall
soon be done time, and commence upon an eternal scene; then our
knowledge will be complete, though no doubt, it will be expanding
for ever, and the effects of it, even in Heaven, will be wonder,
humility, and love, for the mind will incessantly be employed in
roving over the glories of God; as the God of all grace, one in
three, and three in one; seen, apprehended, enjoyed, beheld, and
loved in <i>Christ Jesus</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>And now they range the heavenly plains,<br />
And sing <i>his</i> love in melting strains;<br />
Or, overwhelm&rsquo;d with rapture sweet,<br />
Sink down, adoring at <i>his</i> feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May this be our lot, and in order to that <i>state</i>, that
<i>bliss</i>, that <i>joy</i>, and that sweet
<i>employment</i>.&nbsp; May the eternal spirit give us such
views of Christ, as shall cause us to long for the time.</p>
<p>We are poor sinners, guilty, and hell-deserving, condemned by
a holy law, and exposed to a thousand miseries in this world; and
in our fallen nature, to the woe of perdition.&nbsp; Christ is
the Saviour of the lost; <i>he</i> was from all eternity raised
up, and voluntarily offered <i>himself</i> to become the Saviour
of <i>his</i> church.&nbsp; Say ye of <i>him</i>, whom the Father
hath sanctified&mdash;and for their sakes I sanctify
<i>myself</i>.&nbsp; Set apart, separated, for <i>his</i>
peoples&rsquo; salvation.&nbsp; Glory be to <i>his</i> dear name:
<i>he</i> is God and man; had <i>he</i> been only God, we could
not have been saved; had <i>he</i> been man only, <i>he</i> would
not have been able to save us; but <i>he</i> is God and man; this
at once secures the honors of <i>his</i> law, the glory of
<i>his</i> perfections, and the salvation of <i>his</i>
church.&nbsp; As God and man, <i>he</i> is the Lord, our <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>righteousness, and as the atonement, which alone is
efficacious, <i>he</i> is called the Lord and God, who laid down
<i>his</i> life, and purchased the church with <i>his</i>
blood.&nbsp; How most divinely adapted <i>he</i> was, and
<i>is</i>, to save us.&nbsp; What a glorious meeting of divine
excellencies are in <i>him</i>.&nbsp; Hence, the Father calls
upon us, to behold <i>him</i>, Behold my servant, whom I
uphold.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus declares, <i>he</i> will say of
<i>himself</i>, Behold me, behold me! to a people who had not
known <i>him</i>! and the holy Spirit points <i>him</i> out, by
John; Behold the Lamb of God!&nbsp; I know my dear friend desires
to know <i>him</i>, that she may believe in <i>him</i>, and love
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; This encourages me to go on with my sweet
subject, which I hope will not prove tedious to you.&nbsp; The
person of Christ is most wonderful, it is greater than <i>his</i>
glorious works, and ought to be for ever the theme of our
discourse.&nbsp; Permit me, then, just to observe, there meets in
Jesus, infinite <i>highness</i>, and infinite
<i>humility</i>&mdash;infinite <i>glory</i>, and infinite
<i>condescension</i>&mdash;infinite <i>grace</i>, and infinite
<i>justice</i>&mdash;infinite <i>majesty</i>, and transcendent
<i>meekness</i>&mdash;the deepest <i>reverence</i> of God, and an
<i>equality</i> with God&mdash;infinite <i>worthiness</i> of
good, and the greatest <i>patience</i> under
evils&mdash;wonderful <i>obedience</i>, and supreme
<i>dominion</i> over heaven and earth&mdash;the most perfect
<i>resignation</i>, and absolute <i>sovereignty</i>&mdash;an
entire <i>trust</i> in God, and yet <i>self sufficiency</i> in
<i>himself</i>.&nbsp; <i>Justice</i>, <i>mercy</i>, and
<i>truth</i> are sweetly combined in <i>him</i>, displayed
through <i>him</i>, and shines in all <i>he</i> says, and in all
<i>he</i> does; while, as an high priest, <i>he</i> makes
intercession&mdash;as God and man, <i>he</i> demands the very
blessings: Father, I will, that those whom thou hast given
<i>me</i>, be with <i>me</i>.&nbsp; <i>He</i> is the <i>lion</i>
to our foes; the <i>lamb</i> to our faith, and at times,
<i>he</i> appears the <i>lion</i> in providence, while <i>he</i>
is the lamb, in a way of grace, to the soul.&nbsp; This is your
<i>Christ</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

To be admired, and yet ador&rsquo;d:<br />

<h2>LETTER XVII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Valley of Achor</i>, <i>March</i>
25, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My kind Friend</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mrs</span>. O.</p>
<p>Grace and peace be to you.&nbsp; The wise and good, but solemn
providence of God, having deprived me of the public opportunity
of comforting my afflicted friends, I have no other means of
doing it, but by a few lines, about the best, the most import,
and precious objects, which will take eternity itself, fully to
unfold.&nbsp; You, doubtless, must lament with me, the narrowness
of our minds, in receiving the most blessed things, with
<i>the</i> intrusion of necessary business&mdash;<i>the</i> cares
of life&mdash;<i>the</i> heavy conflicts we have also to
experience, with many painful visits from the enemy of our
souls&mdash;<i>the</i> native reluctant of the body, and
<i>the</i> pressure of many trying thoughts.&nbsp; <i>These</i>
hinder our running the heavenly race, <i>these</i> keep us down,
so that we cannot rise in heavenly mindedness; and a sense of our
past sins, makes us ready to halt, so that we cannot walk
comfortably.&nbsp; But though <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>this is our case, yet blessed be God,
we are not in despair, nor are we out of the promise: They that
wait on the Lord, shall renew their strength; and blessed are all
they that wait for me.&nbsp; This made David deliver this charge:
<i>My soul</i>, <i>wait thou only on God</i>, <i>for my
expectation is from him</i>.&nbsp; What, alas! should we do
without the promises?&nbsp; Grace made them, but the hand of
divine truth is to make them good.&nbsp; Our wants, woes, and
miseries, were all known and consulted, by the adorable trinity;
and dark as we are about the mystery of God, all is clear to
himself.&nbsp; But I lament, I feel a proneness to judge of the
Lord, by carnal reason, and this is like judging of an unfinished
picture, by the original.&nbsp; We must stay till it is finished:
or, like judging of a watch, when it is all in pieces; we may
admire it when put together.&nbsp; I often catch myself at this
work, especially when I am very low, nervous, and tried in mind,
temper, and providence.&nbsp; This is very carnal.&nbsp; May the
blessed spirit quicken faith to rise, and wing its way to eternal
love, eternal grace, eternal mercy, and eternal kindness.&nbsp;
This is its proper element: here we are at home; here is liberty,
peace, joy, and satisfaction.&nbsp; Here we see infinite wisdom,
contriving a <i>time</i> when, a <i>place</i> where, and a
<i>manner</i> how merciful kindness, and melting pity should be
manifested.&nbsp; Here we see every sweet attribute harmonize,
and every grace displayed, while the cross of your dear lovely,
loving Saviour appears truly glorious.&nbsp; See the cluster of
excellencies around it, hymning its praises, with harps of
love.&nbsp; <i>Faith</i> begins the song; <i>hope</i>, full of
immortality joins; <i>loves</i> notes are clearly heard;
<i>joy</i> is sweetly provoked to help repentance with her deep
sounding notes.&nbsp; <i>Zeal</i> most cheerfully moves her
fingers on the harp, while <i>fear</i>, more silently, more
reverently touches the strings.&nbsp; <i>Patience</i> most meekly
assists, and <i>humility</i> sounds her simple airs; yet there is
not one discordant string.&nbsp; Angels listen, and the redeemed
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>above,
beckon us home to the general assembly, that all may bear in the
chorus.&nbsp; And this will be the burden of the song; worthy is
the lamb that was slain: but why the Lamb? but because, in
<i>him</i>, and in <i>his</i> love, person and work, all the
glory of the God of grace is most eminently displayed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here we see the Father&rsquo;s <i>grace</i>,<br />
Beaming in the Saviour&rsquo;s <i>face</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Christ Jesus the glory of God shines, and God is glorified
in <i>him</i>; and God glorified Christ, as man-mediator in
himself, when <i>he</i> brought <i>him</i> from the dead, and set
<i>him</i> at <i>his</i> own right hand.&nbsp; Gave <i>him</i> to
be head over all things, and to fill <i>his</i> people with
spiritual good.&nbsp; <i>He</i> was deeply humbled, and sorely
tried&mdash;<i>he</i> was sharply tempted, and sadly afflicted,
before <i>his</i> exaltation, and we must be conformed to
<i>his</i> image.&nbsp; Before honor, is humility.&nbsp; Christ
found it so, and all <i>his</i> followers must.&nbsp; But when
troubles abound, is it not strange? that though this is the very
time the Saviour is most <i>tender</i>, most <i>careful</i>, and
most <i>indulgent</i> of us, as a parent is of a sick child, more
than the strong and healthy.&nbsp; Yet these are the very seasons
we have most fears, most cares, and most terrors; when, in
reality, we have the least reason.&nbsp; How then, is that
text?&nbsp; For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my ways
as your ways, saith the Lord.&nbsp; And it is very remarkable,
that the greatest part of the precious promises are made to the
tried people of God.&nbsp; I pray the God of all grace, to
strengthen our faith in <i>his</i> love, in <i>his</i> grace, in
<i>his</i> truth, and in <i>his</i> word.&nbsp; O that when we
open the Bible, we could always think we are opening, and looking
into the very heart of God <i>himself</i>; as a God of love; but
we are too apt to read for others, and say, O what sweet things
are here for God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Yes, they are <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for us, and
whatever suits us, that is ours.&nbsp; Whatsoever things were
written afore time, were written for us, that <i>we</i> might
have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge, and we have
fled; trouble, guilt, sin, fear, Satan, world, and conscience has
pursued; but as faith gathers strength in the person, and work of
Christ, we find they cannot hurt us.&nbsp; Thy vengeance will not
strike us <i>here</i>; nor Satan dares our souls invade.&nbsp;
Frighten us he may, but reign, <i>he</i> never can any
more.&nbsp; No, our hearts are bespoke.&nbsp; Christ is the
lover, and faith, prayer, desire, and intreaty has said most
sincerely, Take my poor heart!&nbsp; Set me as a seal upon thine
heart.&nbsp; Lord, take and make me thine! take me as I am.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

<p>There is balmy consolation in Gilead, amongst the <i>heap</i>
of <i>witnesses</i>, and a real physician <i>there</i>, to heal
every wound <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

mount.&nbsp; But many, alas! surround it, that never feed on
it&mdash;many walk about Zion, that never enter into it, and many
have the word, and desire the word, that never did desire, or
enjoy the sincere <i>milk</i> of it.&nbsp; You and I know that
there can be no feeding without life, and this life is seen by
the appetite.&nbsp; Blessed are they, that hunger and thirst
after righteousness; after an increasing knowledge of <i>it</i>,
and after a divine enjoyment of <i>it</i>&mdash;to be found in
<i>it</i>, in death, and to be owned in <i>it</i>, in the last
great day.&nbsp; Ah! this is the rich robe.&nbsp; I pray my dear
friend may be found adorned with it, when the judge shall appear
in awful grandeur; when the elements shall melt with fervent
heat; when the stars shall fall from their sockets, and when sun
and moon; when the grand planetary orbs shall be thrown into
promiscuous ruin, and all creation fly away before the face of
<i>him</i>, who will ere long swear, that time shall be no
more.&nbsp; There are two precious promises, confirmed by the
path of a covenant God.&nbsp; <i>He</i> swore by himself, that in
blessing, <i>he</i> would bless <i>his</i> people.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> has sworn <i>he</i> never will be wroth with, nor
rebuke <i>his</i> people.&nbsp; This is sweet food for precious
faith.&nbsp; O may you feast on it divinely.&nbsp; Because
<i>he</i> could swear by no greater, <i>He</i> swore by himself,
saying, I declare, in blessing you, I will bless you.&nbsp;
Eternal life is in God&rsquo;s blessing, and this life being in
Christ, in blessing, God blesses us for evermore.&mdash;I trust
my dear friend&rsquo;s mind is often led to the Saviour, and that
you prove <i>his</i> preciousness in <i>his</i> sacred person,
<i>his</i> covenant love, <i>his</i> meritorious obedience, and
<i>his</i> atoning blood&mdash;<i>his</i> prevalent intercession,
and <i>his</i> advocacy with the Father.&nbsp; This is the
glorious object of faith, and round <i>him</i> faith hovers, till
it can gather strength enough to lay hold of <i>him</i>&mdash;to
<i>him</i> it often looks, and always bends; and close to
<i>him</i> it cleaves, as the fond ivy entwines round the
oak.&nbsp; This, you doubtless, see in your lowest state, even
when low in <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>body, weak in nerves, barren in mind, tried in the
world, and grieved in the church; and when nature is reluctant;
the flesh a heavy clog, and the spirits within, seem to sink into
earth, as its centre.&nbsp; Yet there is a going to our spiritual
David, though in as helpless a state as lame Mephibosheth, or
aged Barzillai.&nbsp; I have had many strange changes of mind
since I last saw you, but I was never more sensible of the
carrying on, and increase of the work of God in my soul, than I
am now.&nbsp; In my very best state, I can never rise above this
motto.&nbsp; <i>Full of the deepest need</i>.&nbsp; And this line
following, expresses the warmest desires of my heart.&nbsp; Thou,
oh Christ, art all I want.&nbsp; I am learning, daily, to know
<i>his</i> value.&nbsp; I feel my need of <i>him</i> increases,
and strange to tell, the lower I sink in this frame, the higher I
rise in confidence&mdash;in a confidence that I never did so
fully attain before; for if I had a little of it in times past,
company, visiting, the neglect of prayer, and carelessness of
manners, lamed me in both feet.&nbsp; But I find it most blessed
to be kept near the Saviour.&nbsp; I have had some blessed views
of <i>him</i>, and I am covetous for more.&nbsp; I want to enjoy
<i>his</i> love, and to walk in <i>him</i>&mdash;to be adorned
with <i>his</i> light&mdash;to be crowned with <i>his</i> loving
kindness&mdash;to rise superior to the world&mdash;to fight the
good fight, and so to lay hold on eternal life&mdash;to
apprehend, embrace, and enjoy the everlasting favours of God.</p>
<p>I hope my good friend, Mr. R. is well in health and spirits,
as trying times, and body of sin and death will permit.&nbsp; I
hope he is growing in knowledge.&nbsp; This will increase faith,
and beget a blessed confidence, that maketh not ashamed.&nbsp;
The main point with us, is, to beg the Lord, the holy Spirit, to
create a supernatural faculty in our minds, to take in subjects,
truly supernatural, that our affections may be supernatural also;
and where this is the privilege, the mercy and the honor, it is a
most divine <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>evidence, that our persons are in Christ.&nbsp; The most
blessed subject we can ever apprehend, is the love of God.&nbsp;
O to be led with some power to this, so as to conceive of it, as
set upon us.&nbsp; What a favour!&nbsp; We often judge of it by
its effects upon us, and by reflecting on what the holy Spirit
has wrought in us.&nbsp; This is a good plan sometimes; but are
there not periods in your experience, when you doubt of the
reality of the Spirit&rsquo;s work on your own heart?&nbsp; I
find it the most blessed method in my very worst, and in my very
best frame, to fall low at the feet of Jesus, and to study the
love of God, to guilty man, with the joint operation of each
adorable person in the trinity, on the heart.&nbsp; The Father
convinces, chastens, and teaches us, out of <i>his</i> law, and
testifies of <i>his</i> dear son to us.&nbsp; <i>He</i> then
brings us to Christ; the son accepts us, pardons, justifies,
receives, and owns us as <i>his</i> own, while the Holy Spirit,
acts as a divine comforter, sealer, and witness.&nbsp; And when
this is experienced, we have the witness of the water, the blood,
and the spirit; and these three agree in one, to witness our
adoption, and the love of God to us, in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; This,
and this only, reconciles the mind to bear the cross, daily,
whether it be reproach or bondage, whether it be weakness of
body, or trying circumstances, or even if they all come
together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Duties, and trials then appear;<br />
Easy to do, or light to bear.<br />
Whether they many be, or few,<br />
We, through <i>this</i> strength, can all things do.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
